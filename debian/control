Description: Python client library for DICT (RFC2229) protocol
 This is a new library for interacting with Dict servers.
 It defines three classes -- Connection, Database, and Definition.
 It supports all common Dict server requests, including definitions,
 matching, and getting information about available databases,
 capabilities, etc.  You can use it to communicate to a local
 or remote dictd database.  The homepage for this package (includes docs)
 is at gopher://quux.org/1/devel/dictclient.
